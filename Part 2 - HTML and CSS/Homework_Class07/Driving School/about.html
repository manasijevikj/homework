        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>U Drive Driving School today is the combination of local traffic safety programs which have a long history in
            the Seattle area. In 2001 the Fawcett family, owners of Defensive Driving School, joined forces with Seattle
            Driving School, the area’s pioneer driving school which was established in 1945. In January of 2006,
            Kirshner Driving School, which was formed in 1949, joined the Defensive Family. By combining the experience
            and attributes of each program as well as actively participating in State and National driver education
            profession organizations, we’ve developed a classroom and in-car curriculum that produces ticket and
            collision-free drivers. Today, Defensive Driving School has grown to nearly 30 Puget Sound locations with
            more collective years of experience than any other school in Washington</p>
