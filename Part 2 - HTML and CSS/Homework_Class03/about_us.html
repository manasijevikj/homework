    <p> <strong>Our company</strong> <br>
        Speed Cube Store Ltd.

        Speed Cube Store aims to provide solutions to your applications. We provide total magnetic solutions-engineering
        assistance, stock and custom magnets, and complete magnetic sub-assemblies in prototype to production
        quantities. In particular, Magpole Technology specialises in special-shaped and micro magnet of NdFeB, Ferrite,
        SmCo and AlNiCo from olive-shape to mm scale micro magnet. Highly experienced in various areas of specialty, we
        are optimally product to deliver results and cost-effective solutions to our customers. I originally formed a
        cubing store as UK Cubes, and then rebranded to Corner Twist. I ran the store for over 2 years, and absolutely
        loved every second of it. I poured my heart into it, and did everything I could to make it a success, from
        personalised notes in orders, to attending cubing competitions, and to uploading 100s of YouTube videos. Sadly,
        at the start of 2018, I had to close the store due to reasons in my personal life, as well as wanting to go out
        and try new things. Now I've tried the new things, it has strengthened my resolve that selling cubes is the
        thing I'm best at! If you're worried about the store being unprofessional or too new, well I can tell you, I've
        been through it, having worked in cubing for over 3 years. I've made the mistakes, and experienced the
        successes, and I'm going to use everything I know to make Speed Cube Store Ltd. the cubing store you all
        deserve. Thank you all so much, and welcome to Speed Cube Store Ltd.!</p>
