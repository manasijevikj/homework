    <p><strong>Get comfortable because there is a lot to unpack with the GAN's 2020 flagship -- the GAN 11 M Pro
            3x3!</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Positioning System</strong> <br>
        The biggest feature in our opinion is the switch to an industry-first corner/core magnet positioning system.
        Made up of 64 magnets total, the feel of this new system is very different from a traditional corner/edge set
        up.The magnet strength of the core can be interchanged for lighter or stronger magnets and the corner piece
        magnets can be easily adjusted by toggling the "switch" between light, moderate, and strong for maximum
        customization. <br>
        <strong>New Exterior "Finishes"</strong> <br>
        The "Soft" finish is a super soft, rubber feel similar to some computer accessories but does not offer very good
        grip. Available exclusively with "primary" plastic internals. The "UV Coated" finish is a high-gloss, grippy
        feel that is more resistant against scratching and is available exclusively with "primary" plastic internals.The
        "Frosted" finish is what has been used on recent GAN releases and is available with either "primary" or "black"
        plastic internal pieces. <br>
        <strong>Core Adjustment</strong> <br>
        The same dual-adjustment core that originated in the XS is found in the 11 M Pro and allows for 24 different
        adjustment variations through 4 elasticity nut options and 6 spring compression choices.

    <p><strong>The new GAN356 i</strong><br>
        The new GAN356 i brings smart technology to your speed cubing experience delivering a great balance between
        technology and premium performance. The cube is fitted with sensors and controlled with an application (iOS or
        Android) and sports full motion tracking. Smart analytics provides personalised training and statistics on each
        solve giving you indicators for TPS (turns per second), number of cube rotations, and total move count, this
        puzzle. Download the complementary App, 'Cube Station' where you can battle with friends and other cubers
        worldwide! <br>
        <strong>GAN Robot</strong> <br>
        Pair with the GAN Robot [sold separately] and create a truly amazing smart experience. Importantly the cube
        performs like a premium speed cube and inherits features from the very popular 356X GTN, and includes the GAN
        Tensioning Nuts (GTN) but which can now be adjusted by hand , the GAN magnetic capsules housing factory fitted
        magnets and honeycomb contact service.

    <h2 id="bsld">Best Speed Cube Lube Deal</h2>
    <a href="https://www.thecubicle.com/collections/lube" target="_blank"><img src="./images/lube.jpg"
            alt="Speed cube Lube" width="1500"></a>
    <p><strong>Speedcube Lube</strong> <br>
        Speedcube Lube is a high performance silicone lubricant recommended for use with your speed cube. Generally
        lubricants improve speed and control of your speed cube - ensuring you get the optimal solve each time. The
        "weight" of the lube corresponds to how "heavy" your cube will feel after lubing. Weight 1 is the lightest and
        Weight 5 is the heaviest, and other weights are in between. Weight 1 Lube is a fast - high speed lubricant - and
        is meant for everyday lubrication of your cube.
        Weight 5 Lube is thick - gummy - lubricant and is intended for the core cube mechanism and screws.
