Bonus:
Try to think how would you solve the minimum coins problem if you have limited number of coins. For example you know that you have 3 coins of 1c,
5 coins of 5c, 2 coins of 10c etc. But the inputed amount can always be represented with those coins, imagine that there are no exceptional cases.

Begin{
int c10 = 0;
int c5 = 0;
int c1 = 0;
int number;

Output "Vnesi cifra";
Input number;

while (number > 0)
        {
            if(c10 < 2 && number >= 10)
            {
	            c10++;
	            number -= 10;
	        }
	        else
	        {
	            if(c5 < 5 && number >= 5)
	            {
	                c5++;
	                number -= 5;
	            }
	            else
	            {
	                if(c1 < 3 && number >= 1)
	                {
	                    c1++;
	                    number -= 1;
	                }
	            }
	        }
        }
Output "Resenieto e: " 
Output c10+" od po 10 centi, "+c5+" od po 5 centi i "+c1+" od po 1 cent "
